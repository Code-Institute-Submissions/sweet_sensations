Sweet Sensations

Sweet Sensations is a website I built for a friend who has recently started her own business selling baked goods and sweet treats. The primary function of the site is to inform users about the products on offer, to allow them to read reviews by previous customers and to contact Sweet Sensations should they be interested in placing an order. The site also displays images of the products and directs users to Sweet Sensation social media pages for further information. 

UX

The design of the website is minimalist with a background of white which keeps the site looking clean and makes the content stand out. The colour pink also runs throughout the site - a colour I feel pairs well with the baked goods and sweets theme. In addition, the user is never overwhelmed with too much text or information as all text segments are kept quite short and “to-the-point”. This is another feature of the minimalist design.
The navigation bar contains links to all parts of this site, easily directing users exactly where they want to go. This eradicates any confusion about how to navigate through the site - making a smooth user experience.

User story:
•	As a visitor of Sweet Sensations website, I want to view the products on offer (both descriptions and images) as well as the prices. I also want to get some information about the person behind Sweet Sensations and I want to be able to contact her to place an order or make an enquiry. In addition, I would like to read some reviews of previous customers so that I can see that they were happy with their purchases.
•	I can easily navigate through each of these tasks by using the direct links on the navbar which are clearly visible to me as a user.

Wireframing

Testing

The site was tested on 21" monitors, 15" and 13" laptop screens and on the following phone screens: iPhone 6/7/8; Galaxy S5, Pixel 2; Pixel 2XL; iPhone 5/SE; and iPhone x. It was also tested on iPad and iPad Pro screen sizes. The site is responsive and working on all screen sizes. Initially, there was an issue on iPad screens where the navbar was too wide but this was rectified by using media queries to adjust the navigation bar on this screen size.

User testing was done to ensure:

•	All links work correctly.
•	All navbar links work correctly (there was an issue with the testimonials link on the navbar initially from all pages except for the home page – this was because it was not directing to a separate page but rather a certain point on the home page. This was fixed by amending the link on the navbar of each page - On the home, #Testimonials was used to link the user to testimonials further down the page while on all other pages, sweetsensations.html#Testimonials was used instead.
•	Links to social media utilise target="_blank", so that these pages are opened in a new tab. 
•	Google map links correctly when selected

Issues 

•	When viewing the site on internet explorer, the navigation bar is aligned slightly further left than on other browsers.
